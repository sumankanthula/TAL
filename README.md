# TAL
prerequisites tools: .net core5, sql, nodejs, npm
steps: 
1) Clone the project 
2) open from the VS 2019 ( As I have used VS 2019 angular template) just build and then run 
3) I have used entity framework code first approach, so added funcs on the page load to setup the master data 
4) it should connect with this connectionstirng, which is default "Data Source=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Initial Catalog=TALDbContext.TALContext;Integrated Security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True"
5) once the master data set up is done, it will show the Premium Calculator form
